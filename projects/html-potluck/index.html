                                Mike Schmidt, a mall cop, loses his job after 
                                assaulting a negligent father who he confused 
                                for being a kidnapper. He is sent to visit 
                                career counselor Steve Raglan, who offers 
                                him work as a night guard at an abandoned 
                                family diner known as Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. 
                                Though initially reluctant, Mike accepts the 
                                offer after social services threaten to take 
                                custody of his younger sister Abby, and pass 
                                her over to his estranged aunt Jane, due to 
                                concerns of Mike's emotional stress.
                                On the first night, Mike falls asleep and has 
                                a dream where he witnesses the kidnapping and 
                                presumed murder of his brother Garrett, whom 
                                was taken away by an unknown man. Mike is 
                                then met by five unknown children whom 
                                allegedly witnessed the kidnapping, and 
                                promptly run away. On the second night, 
                                Mike meets police officer Vanessa Shelly, 
                                who shows him around the restaurant and tells 
                                him that the place closed in the 1980s after 
                                five children were murdered there; the bodies 
                                were never found. Mike's dream is repeated, 
                                though after Mike attempts to confront one of 
                                the children, he is attacked and wakes up to
                                find himself wounded physically, though his 
                                wounds are treated by Vanessa.
