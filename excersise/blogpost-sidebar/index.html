                    The DRIFTEM crew followed Formula DRIFT across the lower 
                    48 during May in pursuit of capturing fun times and good 
                    memories at the Road Atlanta (Road to the Championship) 
                    and Orlando Speed World (Scorched) stops along the U.S.
                    PRO drifting circuit.We’re not gonna lie! These events 
                    sneak up on everyone like a knock on the door in a great 
                    tandem battle. If May also flew by fast for you, and you 
                    didn’t catch either of these nail-biting events, you’ll 
                    want to catch up on all the door knocking on FD’s 
                    livestream. In the meantime, here’s our recap of some 
                    of the highlights from both events:
            </p>
            <h3> PRO European Domination </h3>
            <p>
                So far this season, FD’s podium has been weighted with 
                Europeans. In fact, the final races in Atlanta and Orlando 
                both ended up involving drivers from the same European 
                regions. We had the ‘Norwegian Finals’ in Atlanta, with 
                Fredric Aasbo (@fredredaasbo) and Simen Olsen 
                (@simenolsendrifting) battling for first, followed by 
                the ‘Irish Finals’, with FD Rookie Conor Shanahan 
                (@conorshanahan79) and three-time champ James Deane 
                (@jamesdeane130), duking it out for top honors in 
                Orlando. Aasbo and Shanahan won their respective races, 
                and the win also crowned Shanahan with a perfect event 
                score after also landing in first place during the 
                seeding bracket round.

                <h3 class="subheading">IN AND OUTS</h3>
                Goon Monsoon As if the whacky weather in Long Beach wasn’t 
                enough of a seasonal shocker, anyone that showed up before 
                the PROSPEC events in Atlanta now knows what a southern 
                monsoon feels like. Fortunately, it didn’t cause too much 
                track havoc, and it was out as fast as it was in. Just in
                time to see all the PROSPEC seeding-bracket drivers
                wrangle each other on semi-dry pavement.
                <h3>License To Shred</h3>
                <p> 
                The PROSPEC circuit welcomed ten newly licensed rookies 
                from around the world at Round 1 this season. Props to 
                inbound U.S. drivers Adam Heishman (@wall_hugs), Allen 
                Boss (@allenboss480), Brian Wills (@nh_fab), Coty Demster 
                (@cotydemster), Jayce Habich (@ls13coupe), Josh Stuart 
                (@stuartfamdrifting), and Nik Jimenez (@nikxjimenez), 
                along with Irish driver Clarke Hatton (@clarkehatton_477),
                Lee Yearwood (@leebird_rb) from Trinidad & Tobago, and 
                Luis Lanz (@luislanz8) from Venezuela.

                <h3> Power Returns To The Alley </h3>
                <p>
                    Extended damage from an unfortunate wall encounter 
                    Mike Power (@mikepowerdrift) had in Long Beach 
                    prevented him from competing in Atlanta, but he
                    returned to the paddock in Florida flashing his 
                    shades, big smile, and a ‘ready-to-win’ spirit
                    (read more on Power in his recent Skid Pod episode).
                </p>
                <h3>Skidding Back In </h3>
                <p>
                After vehicle-related issues forced Matt Field 
                (@mattfield777) and Ryan Litteral (@ryanlitteral) 
                to sit Long Beach out, both drivers were happy to be 
                back at the Atlanta start line. Field’s luck held on a 
                little longer than Litteral’s, but his final win in 
                Atlanta also led to an appeal by Adam LZ (@adam_lz). 
                To learn how it all went down, tune into a recent YouTube 
                broadcast from FD president and co-founder Ryan Sage 
                (@ryanjsage), where he gives the lowdown on the latest 
                appeals, and several FD rule changes.

            <h3>No Flops  </h3>
                <p>
                    Despite some fun banter by the announcers in Atlanta, 
                    giving fans speculation on whether Vaughn Gittin Jr. 
                    (@vaughngittinjr) might deliberately flop during his 
                    ‘Dueling RTR’ battle with teammate James Deane 
                    (@jamesdeane130), the former FD champ did not 
                    disappoint and provided fans a few more signature 
                    ‘Funhaver’ runs to remember.
                    <h3> No Swaps</h3>
                <p>
                    Sooo, Adam LZ (@adam_lz) didn’t go to the Driftmasters 
                    Grand Prix (DMEC) event, and instead, competed in FD 
                    Atlanta this year. Conor Shanahan (@conorshanahan79) 
                    missed FD Atlanta to compete across the pond in DMEC. 
                    Considering Conor didn’t qualify and LZ was less than 
                    satisfied with his Top 32 battle in Atlanta, we can’t 
                    help but wonder if things might have gone down 
                    differently had the two changed places.
                    <h3>Just Kidding </h3>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, it seemed like swaps were all Odi 
                    Bakchis’ (@odidrift) team did during the month of May. 
                    They had to replace his engine the first time following 
                    his Atlanta fire run. Then, that engine failed, and 
                    was swapped again just before Orlando. Yikes! We’re 
                    hoping this one keeps on ticking and doesn’t 
                    explode, Odi.
