                    <p>
                        Red is known to have both physiological and 
                        psychological impacts on people, thus producing 
                        positive and negative effects on us. Studies show 
                        that its warm and vibrant hue gives us more energy to
                        take action. Below are some concepts that are linked 
                        to the color red.

                    <p>
                        We may all agree that red is the color of love, which 
                        involves passion, sexuality, romance, and lust. Whether 
                        we are infatuated, in love, or even broken-hearted, 
                        we immediately think of the color red. It communicates 
                        strong feelings of attraction that can energize and 
                        increase a person’s heart rate.

                    <p>
                        Compared to the rest of the colors, red provokes the 
                        most potent emotions, both healthy and unhealthy. 
                        It makes people feel dominant and powerful by boosting 
                        their self-esteem. In addition, red is a bold color, 
                        which makes one stand out from the crowd and 
                        influences the way others see them.

                    <p>
                        Red also conveys confidence, the state of believing 
                        in one’s abilities and qualities. Wearing a red dress, 
                        red coat, or red lipstick shows that a person is 
                        ready to take on the world and make a big difference. 
                        Red is an essential color to show people what 
                        you’re capable of doing.

                        GSDs were initially bred to tend to large flocks of 
                        sheep — as many as 1,000, by acting as a moving fence. 
                        They run along an invisible line and instinctively 
                        know how to keep the flock in a defined area away 
                        from danger. Watching a GSD’s smooth, flowing, and 
                        efficient gait is a sight. The breed can cover a 
                        maximum amount of ground with a minimum number of steps.

                         day and perform search-and-rescue, bomb detection, 
                         and drug-sniffing duties the next.

                        This breed’s thick, coarse double coat helps insulate

                        To properly maintain it, never shave or cut your GSD’s 
                        coat. Brush it or use a de-shedding tool every other 
                        day to remove loose hair easily.

                        Echinacea, also referred to as the purple coneflower, 
                        is found in the middle latitudes of the US from the 
                        Eastern seaboard to the central US. Purple coneflowers 
                        are part of the daisy family and are found on the 
                        prairie or dry grasslands. The "cone" portion of the 
                        flower is about 1.5 inches across and with petals is 
                        about 4 inches across. They bloom from the end of June
                        through August and reach a height of about four feet.

                        The flowers are small but clustered together in 
                        groupings that are about 3 inches across. This plant 
                        spreads by seeds as well as by rhizomes and is great
