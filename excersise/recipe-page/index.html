                    <h6>OTHER</h6>
                     <ul>
                        <li>1 large egg</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon whole milk</li>

                    <h1>INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
                    <h6>DOUGH</h6>
                    <ol>
                        <li>To a large mixing bowl, add honey, water, and yeast. 
                            Whisk together well.
                        </li>
                        <li>Add bread flour and salt. Bring together with a rubber 
                            spatula until you have a shaggy, dry-looking dough.
                        </li>
                        <li>Transfer to a clean surface and start stretching and 
                        folding the dough to knead it until smooth and elastic. 
                        You can also use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook 
                        attachment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and let 
                        it rise in a warm place until doubled in size.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once doubled in size, divide the dough into 10 equal 
                        pieces. Wrap each piece into a tight ball.
                    </li>
                    <li>Roll out each section into a long thick strip and wrap 
                        in a circle and bring the two ends together to form a 
                        bagel shape.
                    </li>
                   <li>Cover and let the shaped bagels proof again in a warm 
                       place.
                   </li>
                </ol>
        </p>
             <h6>BOILING</h6>
             <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F and prepare a baking sheet with 
                    parchment paper.
                </li>
                    <li>Bring water to a boil in a large pot and add malt 
                        syrup/molasses, salt, and baking soda.
                    </li>
                    <li>While the water simmers, add 2 to 3 bagels at a time. 
                        Boil for 1 minute, then flip over, and boil for 1 
                        minute on the other side.
                    </li>
                    <li>Remove the boiled bagels and place them on the prepared 
                        baking sheet.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h6>BAKING</h6>
                <ol>
                    <li>Beat together the egg and milk in a small bowl to make the 
                    egg wash.
                    </li>
                    <li>Brush each bagel with beaten egg wash and top with 
                        shredded cheddar cheese and thinly sliced jalapenos.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bake until golden brown and crispy, about 18 to 22 
                        minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>Allow to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy!
                    </li>
