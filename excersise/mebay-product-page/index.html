                        The Corvette C5 / C6 chassis have become increasingly 
                        popular in drifting. This real-deal sports car is very 
                        capable out of the box and has a lot of potential as a 
                        drift car.The Wisefab PRO level drift angle kit 
                        includes everything you need to get the best possible 
                        drift features and achieve a 65+ degree steering angle. 
                        Knuckle kinematics have been improved in several ways 
                        and an Ackermann angle adjustment has been added. 
                        Control arms are extended and conveniently adjustable 
                        for quick alignment.When using this kit, you can 
                        benefit from optional "C6 Rack Offset Spacer Kit" that 
                        will allow you to achieve even bigger steering angle 
                        on C6 chassis (not needed on C5) and improves the 
                        Ackermann curve.

                        Recommended alignment parameters:
                        Toe in/out: If Ackermann is 0 or negative then toe is 
                        2mm out. If Ackermann is positive, then toe is 0
