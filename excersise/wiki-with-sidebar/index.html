                <hr>
                <p>
                    Drifting is/a driving technique where the driver 
                    intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction, while 
                    maintaining control and driving the car through the 
                    entirety of a corner or a 
                    turn.The technique causes the rear slip angle to exceed the 
                    front slip angle to such an extent that often the front 
                    wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn 
                    (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or 
                    vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-
                    steering). Drifting is traditionally performed using three
                    methods: clutch kicking (where the clutch is rapidly 
                    disengaged and re-engaged with the intention of upsetting 
                    the grip of the rear wheels),weight transfer (using 
                    techniques such as the Scandinavian flick), and employing 
                    a handbrake turn. This sense of drift is not to be confused 
                    with the four wheel drift, a classic cornering technique 
                    established in Grand Prix and sports car racing.

                    As a motoring discipline, drifting competitions were first 
                    popularized in Japan in the 1970s and further popularized by 
                    the 1995 manga series Initial D. Drifting competitions 
                    are held worldwide and are judged according to the speed,
                    angle, showmanship, and line taken through a corner or 
                    set of corners.[1]

                        Despite the popular belief that drifting originated 
                        in 1970s Japan, this driving technique was first 
                        practiced in Europe before 1950. Automotive icon Enzo 
                        Ferrari credits Italian driver Tazio Nuvolari as being 
                        the inventor of the four-wheel drift. 
                        Later, British racing driver Stirling Moss improved upon 
                        Nuvolari's technique, mastering the art of drifting  
                        through curves in Formula 1 races by steering with 
                        the accelerator pedal. More recently, drifting as a 
                        specialized competition became popular in Japan. It was
                        most popular in the
                        All Japan Touring Car Championship races. 
                        Famous motorcyclis turned driver Kunimitsu Takahashi 
                        was the foremost creator of 
                        drifting techniques in the 1970s. This earned him 
                        several 
                        championships and a legion of fans who enjoyed the
                         spectacle 
                        of smoking tires. The bias-ply racing tires of the 
                        1960s 1980s 
                        lent themselves to driving styles with a high slip 
                        angle. As 
                        professional racers in Japan drove this way, so did 
                        street racers.[5]

                        Keiichi Tsuchiya, known as the 
                        "Drift King"(ドリフトキング,
                        Dorifuto Kingu), became particularly interested 
                        in Takahashi's
                        drift techniques. Tsuchiya began practicing 
                        his drifting 
                        skills on the mountain roads of Japan, and quickly gained 
                        a reputation amongst the racing crowd. In 1987, 
                        several 
                        popular car magazines and tuning garages agreed to 
                        produce 
                        a video of Tsuchiya's drifting skills. The video,
                         known 
                        as Pluspy,[6] became a hit and inspired many of 
                        the 
                        professional drifting drivers on the circuits today. 
                        In 1988, alongside Option magazine founder and chief 
                        editor Daijiro Inada, he helped to organize one of 
                        the first events specifically for drifting called the I
                        katen (short for Ikasu 
                        Hashiriya Team Tengoku). He has also drifted through 
                        every turn in Tsukuba Circuit.

                            One of the earliest recorded drift events outside
                             Japan took 
                            place in 1996 at Willow Springs Raceway in Willow 
                            Springs, 
                            California, hosted by the Japanese drifting 
                            magazine and 
                            organization Option. Daijiro Inada 
                            (founder of the Japanese D1 
                            Grand Prix), the NHRA Funny Car drag 
                            racer Kenji Okazaki, and 
                            Keiichi Tsuchiya gave demonstrations in a 
                            Nissan 180SX that 
                            the magazine had brought over from Japan. 
                            Entrants included
                            Rhys Millen and Bryan Norris.[7] Drifting 
                            has since exploded 
                            into a form of motorsport in North America, 
                            Australia, Asia 
                            and Europe. Grassroots drifting has seen a 
                            huge increase in 
                            popularity in the 21st century, which has in 
                            turn caused 
                            prices of FR cars to increase and parts become
                             more scarce.

                        Drifting has evolved into a competitive sport where
                         drivers 
                        compete (almost exclusively in rear-wheel-drive cars) 
                        to earn 
                        points from judges based on various factors. At the 
                        top levels 
                        of competition, the D1 Grand Prix in Japan pioneered 
                        the sport. 
                        Other events such as Drift Games Extreme (formally 
                        known as the 
                        IDC — Irish Drift Championship) in Ireland, Formula 
                        D in the United
                        States, Drift Allstars, King of Europe, Drift Masters 
                        and the 
                        British Drift Championship in Europe, WDS in China, 
                        RDS in Russia
                        , Formula Drift Asia in the Malaysia/Singapore/
                        Thailand/Indonesia
                        /Philippines, NZ Drift Series in New Zealand, the 
                        Australian 
                        Drifting Grand Prix, Spec - D Drift Series in Western 
                        Canada and 
                        the Greek Drift Championship (Drift Wars) have come 
                        along to 
                        further expand it into a legitimate motorsport 
                        worldwide. Drivers 
                        within these series are able to keep their cars 
                        sliding for 
                        extended periods of time, often linking several turns.

                        Judging takes place on just a small part of the circuit, 
                        a few linking corners that provide good viewing, and 
                        opportunities for drifting. The rest of the circuit is 
                        irrelevant, but it pertains to controlling the 
                        temperature 
                        of the tires and setting the car up for the first 
                        judged 
                        corner. In tandem passes, the lead driver (in the 
                        lead car, 
                        Senko) often feints their entry to the first corner to 
                        upset the chase driver (in the chase car, Atooi); 
                        however, 
                        in some European series, this practice is frowned 
                        upon by 
                        judges and considered foul play, resulting in deduction
                         of
                        points.

                        There are typically two sessions – a qualifying or 
                        practice 
                        session, and a final session. In qualifying sessions, 
                        referred to as “solo runs” (単走, tansō), drifters get 
                        individual passes in front of judges (who may or may
                         not 
                        be the final judges) to try to make the final 16.
                         This is 
                        often on the day preceding the final.

                        There is some regional variation. 
                        For example, in Australia, the chase car is judged on 
                        how accurately it emulates the drift of the lead car, 
                        as opposed to being judged on its own merit — this is 
                        only taken into consideration by the judges if the lead 
                        car is on the appropriate racing line.[10] Other 
                        variations 
                        of the tansō/tsuisō and the tansō-only method is
                         multi-car
                        group judging, seen in Drift Tengoku videos where the 
                        four-car team is judged in groups.[11]

                        The D1GP drift series has been prototyping and
                         fine-tuning 
                        an electronic judging system based on custom 
                        sensors that 
                        record and transmit car data to a computer that
                         judges the
                        run. This system is also being tested in some European 
                        series. It is designed to remove subjectivity and/or 
                        predisposition of judges. Usually the track for such a 
                        system is broken up into several sections
                         (usually three) 
                        and the system automatically generates scores based on 
                        speed, angle and fluidity of the driver in each section, 
                        combining the scores for the final score. In certain 
                        situations judges can change or overrule a score, which 
                        happens, though rarely.

                        Drift cars are usually light- to moderate-weight 
                        rear-wheel-drive coupes and sedans, offering a large 
                        range of power levels. There have also been all-wheel 
                        drive cars that have been converted to rear-wheel drive 
                        such as the Subaru WRX, Toyota Avensis, Scion tC,
                        Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, Dodge Charger, and Nissan 
                        GT-R. Early on, AWD cars without conversion were 
                        allowed in some drifting competitions, and usually 
                        the rules allowed only a certain percentage of power 
                        to be sent to the front wheels, but they are banned in 
                        most (if not all) drifting competitions today.

                        Despite the possibility of obtaining desirable Japanese 
                        domestic market vehicles in continents outside 
                        Japan,[14] drifters in other countries prefer to use 
                        local versions of the same cars (for example, a Nissan 
                        240SX instead of a Nissan Silvia S13, etc.), or even 
                        domestic cars. A high volume of Japanese imports were 
                        brought to countries such as Australia and New Zealand, 
                        however it is not unusual to see Australian/New Zealand 
                        domestic vehicles.
