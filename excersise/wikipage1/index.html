             <b>Crown shyness</b>(also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1] </sup>canopy
                shyness,
                <sup>[2]</sup> or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon 
                observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully 
                stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with 
                channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup>. The phenomenon
                is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs 
                between trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist
                many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior,
                and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of 
                leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

                The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.
                <sup>[6]</sup>The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature 
                since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses and 
                experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms 
                across different species, an example of convergent evolution.
                <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
            </p>
         <p> Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
                leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in windy 
                areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during
                winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness 
                response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely 
                uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.
                <sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns are artificially prevented from 
                colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.
                <sup>[11]</sup> This explains instances of crown shyness between 
                branches of the same organism.Proponents of this idea cite that 
                shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this 
                pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, 
                and early succession forests where branches are flexible and 
                limited in lateral movement.<sup>[6][12]</sup> According to this 
                theory, variable flexibility in lateral branchesgreatly influences 
                the degree of crown shyness.

            <p>Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at 
                growth nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable to 
                continue with lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. Jacobs,
                who studied the crown shyness patterns in eucalyptus in 1955, 
                believed that the trees' growing tips were sensitive to 
                abrasion, resulting in canopy gaps.[13] Miguel Franco (1986) 
                observed that the branches of <i>Picea sitchensis</i> (Sitka 
                spruce) and <i> Larix kaempferi</i> (Japanese larch) suffered physical 
                damage due to abrasion, which killed the leading 
                shoots.<sup>[14][15]</sup>
             </p>
             <p>A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with 
                 mutual light sensing by adjacent plants. The 
                 photoreceptor-mediated shade avoidance response is a
                 well-documented behavior in a variety of plant species.[16] 
                 Neighbor detection is thought to be a function of several 
                 unique photoreceptors. Plants can sense the proximity of 
                 neighbors by sensing backscattered far-red light, a task 
                 widely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the 
                 phytochrome photoreceptors.<sup>[17]</sup> Many species of 
                 plant respond to an increase in far-red light (and, by 
                 extension, encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away 
                 from the far-red stimulus and by increasing the rate of 
                 elongation.<sup>[18]</sup> Similarly, plants use blue light 
                 to induce the shade-avoidance response, likely playing a role
                 in the recognition of neighboring plants,<sup>[19]</sup> 
                 though this was just starting to be recognised in 1988.
                 <sup>[20]</sup> 
            </p>
            <p>The characterization of these behaviors might suggest that 
                 crown shyness is simply the result of mutual shading based 
                 on well-understood shade avoidance responses.<sup>[6][21]</sup>
                 Malaysian scholar Francis S.P. Ng, who studied <i> Dryobalanops 
                 aromatica</i>, suggested that the growing tips were sensitive to
                 light levels and stopped growing when nearing the adjacent 
                 foliage due to the induced shade.<sup>[6][21]</sup>
                </p>
                <p> A 2015 study has suggested that Arabidopsis thaliana 
                    shows different leaf placement strategies when grown 
                    amongst kin and unrelated conspecifics, shading dissimilar
                    neighbors and avoiding kin. This response was shown to be 
                    contingent on the proper functioning of multiple 
                    photosensory modalities.[22] A 1998 study proposed 
                    similar systems of photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of 
                    growth as explanations of crown shyness,<sup>[6][21]</sup>
                    though a causal link between photoreceptors and crown
                    asymmetry had yet to be experimentally proven. This might
                    explain instances of intercrown spacing that are only
                    exhibited between conspecifics.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
