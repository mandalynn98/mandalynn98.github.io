            <b>Crown shyness</b>(also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1] </sup>canopy
             shyness,
              <sup>[2]</sup> or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>) is a phenomenon 
             observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully 
             stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with 
             channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup>. The phenomenon
             is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs 
             between trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sub> There exist
             many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior,
              and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of 
              leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

        The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.[6] The 
        phenomenon has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.
        [9] The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest 
        that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an 
        example of convergent evolution.[citation needed]
